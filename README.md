# RETS-Client
This is a RETS/DDF (Real Estate Transaction Standard/Data Distribution Format) Client API library for TypeScirpt projects.

## Introduction:

We've created a new RETS client because we saw a clear need in the market for a client that met current RESO specifications and was actively maintained. We noticed that many existing RETS clients appeared to be abandoned or were barely maintained, which made it difficult for developers to rely on them for their projects.

As developers ourselves, we understand how frustrating it can be to use tools that fall short of our needs or are no longer supported. We believe that having an up-to-date and well-maintained RETS client is crucial for the success of any real estate software or website project, which is why we've invested our time and resources in creating a new client that meets current RESO specifications and is actively maintained.

We actively maintain this project to ensure long-term support for our clients and partners and in turn, we hope that this will help to encourage more developers to use RETS in their projects.

## Conclusion:

We hope that our RETS client will help developers to streamline their real estate projects and avoid the headaches that come with using outdated or poorly maintained tools. We are committed to keeping our client up-to-date and supporting it over the long-term, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. Thank you for your interest in our project!
